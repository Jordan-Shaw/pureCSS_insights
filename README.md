# Pure CSS Insights Tech Test
## Background
This project was a simple styling tech test for The Insights People. It started life as another masonry grid, but honestly looked pretty bad. So, I decided to make a simple design that attempts to ape neumorphic design, and is responsive at a basic level.

If I were to continue working on this project I would make use of the id's I've provided to each content container to animate them somehow. Perhaps increasing the opacity of each from 0 to 100% in a staggered timeline on page loading. I would also work on improving the look of the neumorphic effect. 

You will need a local environment to run the PHP script. I recomment MAMP, which worked nice and easily for me.
